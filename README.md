# Offline & Offline2Online Reinforcement Learning
`April 2023`: This repository contains experiments of different reinforcement learning algorithms applied to 3 MuJoCo environments - `Walker2d, Hopper and Halfcheetah`. Essentially, there are 2 models in comparison: Adaptive Behavior Cloning Regularization [1] (in short, `redq_bc`) and Supported Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning [2] (in short, `spot`).<br /><br />
`July-September 2023 update`: There are also additional implementations of:

At the moment offline training is realised for this models. Logs (of only training actually, unfortunately, without evaluation as it was forbidden on the machine to install mujoco stuff, so I trained the models with preloaded pickle and json datasets) are available up below.

## General setup (April 2023)
I've chosen these datasets from gym as they are from MuJoCo, i.e. require learning of complex underlying structufe of the given task with trade-off in short-term and long-term strategies and Google Colab doesn't die from them ;). I have also used `d4rl` [3] library at https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/d4rl as a module to get offline dataset. Datasets used from `d4rl` for environments mentioned above: `medium` and `medium-replay`. Both models have the same base structure in architecture and training - actor-critic model [6] combined with Double Q-learning ([7], [8]).

Models (both redq_bc and spot) were trained on this offline dataset first using `Adam` optimizer with `lr = 3e-4`. The same with online training. Scripts can be found in appropriate folders (`adaptive_bc` and `spot`)

## Models (April 2023)

All available models can be tested in colab opening `inference.ipynb`. Examples of evaluation can be found in `video` folder.

### Adaptive Behavior Cloning Regularization for Stable Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning
redq_bc is implemented to adaptively weigh the L2 loss associated with offline dataset distribution during online fine-tuning on order to stabilise the training. This loss is constructed into the architecture to prevent sudden distribution shift from offline to online data with such simple regularisation that requires minimum code changes (the method is located in the `adaptive_bc` folder, there is also `paper` folder with key moments from the following paper to realise the model). Logs are available at: https://wandb.ai/zzmtsvv/adaptive_bc

### Supported Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning
spot is also implemented to mitigate the problem of the distribution shift by adding a density-based constraint to the main objective. The offline behavior density is realised with Conditional VAE ([4], [5]) that reconstructs action joint with condition (state in this case). VAE is trained as usual and then its loss is used as a r√©gularisation term in offline and online training (there is also additional cooling component in online fine-tuning for more stable handling of distribution shift). The method is located in the `spot` folder, there is also `paper` folder with key moments from the following paper to realise the model, Tensorboard plots can be seen in `graphs` folder.

## Results (April 2023)
As can be seen from plots and concrete examples on videos, `spot` performs much better than `redq_bc`. Intuitively, it can be connected with the fact both works brings additional regularization term during training, in fact, density-constraint support defined in spot can handle offline distribution support more succesfully than L2 term in redq_bc due to its bigger complexity. Furthermore, additional research on latent space of VAE can potentially bring impact in offline2online field.
