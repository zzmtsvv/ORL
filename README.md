# Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains experiments of different reinforcement learning algorithms applied to 3 MuJoCo environments - `Walker2d, Hopper and Halfcheetah`. Essentially, there are 2 models in comparison: Adaptive Behavior Cloning Regularization [1] (in short, `redq_bc`) and Supported Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning [2] (in short, `spot`).

## General setup
I've chosen these datasets from gym as they are from MuJoCo, i.e. require learning of complex underlying structufe of the given task with trade-off in short-term and long-term strategies and Google Colab doesn't die from them ;). I have also used d4rl [3] library at https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/d4rl. Datasets used from d4rl for environments mentioned above: `medium` and `medium-replay`.
